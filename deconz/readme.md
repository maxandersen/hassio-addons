## Options

The conbee flag is needed if you use a conbee adapter. It adds fake udev entries, so that deCONZ recognises the adapter. I would appreciate feedback if it doesnâ€™t work. 

The xpra flag starts the full GUI and allows to access it with [Xpra](http://xpra.org).  
`xpra attach tcp/hassio.local:8236`


wsport is the websocket port

httpport is the main http port. The link to the web ui follows the port mapping of port 8234.


## Caveats

This addon uses the host network because otherwise the websocket port is not easily changeable. This might change in the future. The port mappings are displayed just for reference.
