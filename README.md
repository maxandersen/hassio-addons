# Max's Addons for Hass.io - EXPERIMENTAL

Add https://github.com/maxandersen/hassio-addons as a repository URL. 

This repo contains hass.io addons I've had the need or interest in creating/patching.

deconz
======

Based on https://github.com/neffs/hassio-addons which for some reason just works for me
as opposed to https://github.com/marthoc/hassio-addons.

Currently just provide latest-beta and with a few fixes to work with newer version of deconz.

Only use if you are okey using latest-greatest.
